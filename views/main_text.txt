The Chemical Transformation Simulator (CTS) provides the calculated physico-chemical properties of the parent chemical and transformation products, which are predicted as a function of the reaction system of interest.  This is accomplished through the integration of cheminformatics applications for the encoding of process science underlying transformation pathways, computational chemistry tools for the calculation of physico-chemical properties, and software technologies that provide access to on-line databases for environmental descriptors required for estimating environmental concentrations.

The user interacts with the alpha-version of the CTS through the execution of one of three available work flows (green tabs in left column) described below.  Each workflow invokes the CTS modules required to provide the data requested by the user.  Descriptions of the individual modules are provided by the tabs in the left-hand column.

<b>Chemical Editor (CE):</b>
Provides options for chemical entry, as well as the chemical speciation of the parent chemical
<br><br>
<b>Physicochemical Properties Calculator (PPC):</b>
Calculates p-chem properties for the parent chemical and predicted transformation products based on the executions of multiple p-chem calculators
<br><br>
<b>Reaction Pathway Simulator (RPS):</b>
Generates potential transformation products based on user-specified reaction conditions
