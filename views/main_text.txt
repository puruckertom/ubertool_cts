The Chemical Transformation Simulator (CTS) provides the calculated physico-chemical properties of the parent chemical and transformation products, which are predicted as a function of the reaction system of interest.  This is accomplished through the integration of cheminformatics applications for the encoding of process science underlying transformation pathways, computational chemistry tools for the calculation of physico-chemical properties, and software technologies that provide access to on-line databases for environmental descriptors required for estimating environmental concentrations.

<p>
The user interacts with the alpha-version of the CTS through the execution of one of three available work flows (green tabs in left column) described below.  Each workflow invokes the CTS modules required to provide the data requested by the user.  Descriptions of the individual modules are provided by the tabs in the left-hand column. 
</p>

<p><b>Calculate Chemical Speciation Workflow:</b>  Invokes the Chemical Editor (CE) Module which provides the user options for chemical entry and calculates the speciation (i.e., ionization, tautomer distribution and isomerization) for the chemical of interest.</p>

<p><b>Calculate Physico-Chemical Properties Workflow:</b>  The User inputs chemical information through the CE and then invokes the Physico-Chemical Properties Calculator (PCP) Module.  The PCP Module then calls upon four stand-alone widely recognized calculators (EPI Suite, SPARC, ChemAxon, and Test),  all of which calculate p-chem properties by mutually exclusive methods.</p>

<p><b>Generate Transformation Products Workflow:</b>  The User inputs chemical information through the CE and then invokes the Reaction Pathway Simulator (RPS) Module to generate transformation products through the execution of reaction libraries based on user-specified conditions.  The User is then given the option to invoke the PCP Module for the calculation of p-chem properties for one or more parent or product chemicals.</p>

<h3><b>Reaction Libraries</b></h3>

<p>Version 1.4 of the Abiotic Reduction Reaction Library contains 8 reaction schemes.  Left click a reaction scheme to view the generalized reaction scheme, supporting reaction rules for reactivity, selectivity and exclusion, as well as example transformation pathways based on the execution of the reaction scheme.  References to process science on which the reaction scheme was developed are also provided.</p>

<p>Version 1.6 of the Abiotic Hydrolysis Reaction Library contains 25 reaction schemes.  Left click a reaction scheme to view the generalized reaction scheme, supporting reaction rules for reactivity, selectivity and exclusion, as well as example transformation pathways based on the execution of the reaction scheme.  References to process science on which the reaction scheme was developed are also provided.</p>

<p>The Mammalian Metabolism Reaction Library contains 156 reaction schemes based on CYP450 Phase 1 biotransformations.  This reaction library was developed by Chemaxon.  The reaction library is proprietary, and thus, details of the reactions schemes cannot be viewed.</p>

<h3><b>CTS Modules</b></h3>

<p><b>Chemical Editor (CE):</b> Provides options for chemical entry by entering a SMILES string, IUPAC name, CAS#, or by drawing a structure for the chemical of interest.  Through the execution of the Calculate Chemical Speciation Workflow, the chemical speciation of a chemical, which includes the calculation of ionization constants, the dominant tautomer distribution, as well as structures for all possible isomers, can be calculated/generated. </p>

<p><b>Physicochemical Properties Calculator (PPC): </b> Calculates p-chem properties for the parent chemical and predicted transformation products based on the executions of multiple p-chem calculators.  The PPC is based on a consensus approach that would allow the user to compare output generated by a number of calculators that take different approaches to calculating specific physicochemical properties.  The calculators we are currently accessing include (1) SPARC (SPARC Performs Automated Reasoning in Chemistry), which uses a mechanistic-based approach, (2) EPI Suite, which uses a fragment-based approach, (3) TEST (Toxicity Estimation Software Tool), which uses QSAR-based approaches, and (4) ChemAxon plug-in calculators, which use an atom-based fragment approach.  The user also has the option to request measured data that is available in the EPI Suite p-chem database.  </p>

<p><b>Reaction Pathway Simulator (RPS):</b> Generates potential transformation products based on user-specified reaction conditions.  The output of the RPS is based on the selection and execution of reaction libraries that represent reaction schemes for the transformation of reactive functional groups (i.e., reduction and hydrolysis).  These reaction schemes represent viable transformation pathways based on the identification and subsequent transformation of the reactive functional groups.  A reaction library for human metabolism for phase 1 transformations developed by ChemAxon is also available through the RPS.  The development of reaction libraries allow us to “encode” the known process science published (current and future) in the peer-reviewed literature.  The encoding of process science is accomplished through the use of Chemical Terms Language and cheminformatics applications.  The execution of these reaction libraries provides dominant transformation pathways and products for the chemical of interest as a function of environmental conditions.  The user also has the option to execute the PPC for the calculation of p-chem properties for the parent chemical and transformation products. </p>
